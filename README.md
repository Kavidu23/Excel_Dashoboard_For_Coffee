## üí° What I Learned

This project was a comprehensive learning experience in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using Excel. Below are some of the key functions and techniques I mastered:

### üîç XLOOKUP

- **Purpose:** Modern and powerful alternative to VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP for looking up values in any direction.
- **Application:** Used to retrieve customer names, coffee types, unit prices, and related data based on IDs.

### üß© INDEX & MATCH

- **Purpose:** Useful for complex lookups and returning values from non-adjacent columns.
- **Application:** Practiced to understand multi-criteria lookup logic and flexibility over XLOOKUP.

### ‚úÖ IF / IFS

- **IF:** Used for simple true/false conditions (e.g., loyalty card = "Yes"/"No").
- **IFS:** Used for multiple condition checks (e.g., profit margins, sales tiers).

### üßπ Remove Duplicates

- **Purpose:** Ensured unique records in datasets before performing lookups and aggregations.

### üìê Convert to Table

- **Purpose:** Transformed cleaned data into structured Excel Tables for better formatting, filtering, and pivot integration.
- **Benefits:**
  - Structured references (e.g., `Table1[Unit Price]`)
  - Auto-expansion
  - Enhanced compatibility with PivotTables and Charts
  - Built-in filtering and validation
